Shield-MPPI combines sampling-based planning and safety enforcement through Control Barrier Functions (CBFs), enabling real-time, robust trajectory generation for autonomous racing on the F1TENTH platform. The system integrates EKF-based tracking, spline evasion planning, and a modular ROS2 architecture to ensure safety under dynamic racing conditions.
